# Cyber Security Intelligence

Cyber security intelligence is a very broad field that covers all kinds of information, documents, and events regarding cybersecurity. It encompasses the collection, analysis, and application of information about threats, vulnerabilities, adversaries, attack techniques, and emerging risks to help organizations defend against cyber attacks and make informed security decisions.

Today, cyber attacks are carried out by organized groups of threat actors (Advanced Persistent Threats, nation-state actors, cybercrime syndicates) as well as individual attackers. The world of cybersecurity has become a vast ecosystem where there are cybersecurity experts, users of cybersecurity products and information systems on one side, and cyber criminals on the other side, and both sides are in constant change, evolution, and adaptation.

In such a fast-moving world, unfortunately, just using up-to-date operating systems, up-to-date network devices, and up-to-date security products is not enough to stay safe. While these measures are essential at a foundational level, they are only the beginning. Another imperative is to **follow what is happening in this world very closely and in as real-time as possible**. Because you may be the next target of a threat actor currently targeting an institution on the other side of the world. Therefore, it is critically important to be informed about these events as early as possible, access their details, and check as soon as possible whether similar risks apply to your organization.

## Practical examples of cyber security intelligence

Let's try to understand the value of cyber security intelligence with some concrete examples:

- **IP address correlation**: By looking in the logs of our own security devices for the IP address that a threat actor used to attack a different company, we can determine whether the same actor is targeting us or has already attempted reconnaissance or exploitation.

- **Attack vector awareness**: If we know the applications or services that actors use as entry points in their successful attacks targeting different institutions (e.g., vulnerable VPN appliances, unpatched web servers, specific CMS platforms), we can check whether we use these applications/services and, if so, take precautions (patching, configuration hardening, compensating controls) before an incident occurs.

- **Signature and rule development**: If we can access the payload information that actors use to attack a web service, we can develop and deploy detection/prevention rules in our IDS, IPS, WAF, and other security products to block or alert on similar attacks.

- **Hash-based blocking**: If we have the hash information (MD5, SHA256) of an executable file or a web shell that actors use during attacks, we can prevent the attacker from successfully deploying these tools by defining this hash information in our endpoint security product (EDR, antivirus) and blocking execution.

- **Context-based detection**: When it comes to cyber security intelligence, every piece of data and information can be important. Intelligence does not always have to be about overtly harmful activities. For example, let's say your organization has a mobile application that runs on customers' mobile phones. Under normal circumstances, we would expect this application to be accessed only from end-user (residential) IP addresses. It is at least suspicious if the IP address reaching this application belongs to a data center or hosting provider. The person trying to access your application using this IP address may be a legitimate user using a VPN service hosted in the relevant data center, or it may be an attacker trying to access your mobile application and scan for vulnerabilities through a server they have compromised or rented. In this case, even if this IP address is clean according to reputation services, it is suspicious from a contextual perspective. If we have an intelligence source that provides residential or data center IP address classification, we can develop rules and measures on this issue.

- **Data leakage monitoring**: Another critical issue is "what leaks from us." Attackers do not always harm us by exploiting vulnerabilities in our web services/applications or zero-days in the systems we use. For example, a notebook that one of our users drops while walking on the street, with their email address and password written inside, is also a risk and a matter of intelligence for us. The user will probably not report "I lost my notebook with my passwords in it." However, this type of data can be shared and sold by attackers in underground forums and dark web markets (e.g., paste sites, credential dumps, breach databases). Therefore, it is important for us to stay aware of what is happening in these spaces to stay safe and respond quickly to compromised credentials.

As we understand from these examples, **the more we expand our coverage of cyber security intelligence, the safer we are**. Intelligence enables proactive defense rather than reactive incident response.

For **Vulnerability Management**, which is the subject of our course, we first need to know what the current vulnerabilities are, and this information is a foundational part of cyber security intelligence.

Now let's take a look at how we can access this intelligence.

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Collecting information from publicly available sources—forums, blogs, news sites, official vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD), social media, paste sites, GitHub repositories, and security mailing lists—is called **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)**. Although there are many OSINT resources on the Internet, the two most important resources that list vulnerabilities for Vulnerability Management are **CVE** and **NVD**.

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a vulnerability identification and classification system. **CVE.org** is the official website related to this system and is managed by **MITRE Corporation**. This platform provides information security professionals, system administrators, and software developers with a framework to identify, classify, and share vulnerabilities in a standardized way.

<img width="3558" height="1864" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f065dbcb-4653-4357-b8c6-ea5c126e1255" />

When security researchers, software companies, or other parties discover a vulnerability, they report this information to the CVE Program through a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). MITRE or a CNA reviews this notification and creates a **unique CVE ID** for each vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2024-1234). In the next step, information such as details of the vulnerability, the systems it affects, possible impacts, and solution suggestions are collected, and this information is published in the CVE database and made available for public access. CVE records are updated as new information about the vulnerability comes in or the status of the vulnerability changes (e.g., when patches are released).

<img width="3558" height="2000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8babe4-d1f5-4534-a5aa-b287d59363d9" />

All this information is integrated with security products (vulnerability scanners, SIEM, threat intelligence platforms) and made available to security professionals, thanks to the infrastructure support provided by CVE. The CVE system enables consistent communication and correlation across tools and organizations.

### NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

NVD is a vulnerability database managed by the United States' **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**. NVD is based on the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system and provides **more details, metrics, and analysis** about these vulnerabilities.

<img width="3558" height="2000" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26ab2e54-fde9-470f-9d99-fac3c4830c5b" />

NVD uses the CVE database as a source, but enriches CVE records with additional information such as:

<img width="1600" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3ea62f4-b62c-40e6-abdb-2a5d495de9ce" />

- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores**: Numerical severity ratings based on exploitability, impact, and other factors.
- **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) mappings**: Classification of the underlying weakness or flaw type (e.g., CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting).
- **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) identifiers**: Standardized names for affected products and versions.
- **References**: Links to vendor advisories, patches, proof-of-concept exploits, and technical write-ups.
- **Known exploited vulnerabilities**: Integration with CISA KEV catalog and other exploit intelligence.

<img width="1600" height="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb4efca-1709-4bf6-a551-db8bba01d6e2" />

NVD classifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities according to various criteria, making it easier for organizations to assess risk and prioritize remediation.

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

CVSS uses **three main sets of metrics** when scoring vulnerabilities:

<img width="1816" height="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4269095a-8b3b-4430-b2a4-df682c02cb17" />

#### 1. Base Metrics

These metrics evaluate the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that remain constant over time and across environments:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Specifies the method by which the attack will be made (Network, Adjacent Network, Local, Physical).
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Indicates how complex the attack is (Low or High).
- **Privileges Required (PR)**: Shows what privileges are needed for the attack (None, Low, High).
- **User Interaction (UI)**: Whether the attack requires user interaction (None or Required).
- **Scope (S)**: Whether exploitation of the vulnerability can affect resources beyond the vulnerable component (Unchanged or Changed).
- **Impact Metrics**: Evaluate the impact on Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) (None, Low, High).

#### 2. Temporal Metrics

These metrics evaluate factors that may change over time:

- **Exploit Code Maturity (E)**: The maturity and availability of exploit code (Not Defined, Unproven, Proof-of-Concept, Functional, High).
- **Remediation Level (RL)**: The status of the current solution (Official Fix, Temporary Fix, Workaround, Unavailable, Not Defined).
- **Report Confidence (RC)**: Accuracy of information about the vulnerability (Unknown, Reasonable, Confirmed, Not Defined).

#### 3. Environmental Metrics

These metrics evaluate how impactful the vulnerability will be in a particular organizational environment:

- **Modified Base Metrics**: Organizations can adjust base metrics to reflect their specific environment (e.g., lower impact if compensating controls are in place).
- **Confidentiality Requirement (CR), Integrity Requirement (IR), Availability Requirement (AR)**: Reflect the importance of the affected asset to the organization (Low, Medium, High, Not Defined).

Using these metrics, a **CVSS score between 0.0 and 10.0** is calculated for each vulnerability. The higher the score, the more critical the vulnerability is considered.

**CVSS severity ratings:**

- **0.0 - 3.9**: Low
- **4.0 - 6.9**: Medium
- **7.0 - 8.9**: High
- **9.0 - 10.0**: Critical

The CVSS score is a standardized scoring system designed to help organizations assess risk, prioritize vulnerabilities, and take appropriate security measures. However, CVSS should be combined with organizational context (asset criticality, exploitability, threat intelligence) for effective prioritization.

## Commercial and specialized resources

Apart from open sources, there are also **commercial security products and services** that search for security vulnerabilities, classify them, and provide enriched intelligence to their customers. These services generally work by constantly scanning the vulnerabilities in the existing software and hardware inventories of the customers they serve and generating reports and alarms in case of any risk. They contribute to creating a safe environment by automating and scheduling these scans and providing actionable insights.

### Tenable.io

As an example of these services, we can look at the cloud-based service offered by **Tenable Security** and available at **tenable.io**. This service scans your assets (servers, workstations, network devices, cloud resources) at intervals you specify and produces a report of your current security status. For example, if the version of a web server you run within your organization is a vulnerable version, it will detect and report this to you with remediation guidance.

<img width="1600" height="897" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f30f6a7-ab2b-4291-8f54-d8405825641f" />

Tenable.io offers advanced methods for monitoring your existing assets both inside and outside the organization, using sensors and agents to scan systems that cannot be accessed from outside the organization when necessary. The platform provides:

<img width="3580" height="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03f718ab-5d93-41ea-b4ae-a170903672f5" />

- Asset discovery and inventory
- Vulnerability identification and prioritization
- Compliance and configuration assessment
- Integration with ticketing and workflow systems

<img width="1600" height="858" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcbc4db5-e04e-49a9-ac21-7ffc53944b92" />

### Acunetix

We can give **Acunetix** as another example of these services. Acunetix is an automatic scanning tool used to evaluate the security of web applications. It is specifically designed to detect, analyze, and report security vulnerabilities in web applications. Acunetix can detect many different types of web vulnerabilities such as:

<img width="3580" height="1822" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcf5c49f-7553-4d49-8ed2-738b5ea29c73" />

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Security misconfigurations
- Sensitive data exposure

<img width="3580" height="1822" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3173eb1-00f7-4911-b778-eb1d0b93a2fc" />

Acunetix offers both automatic scanning options and tools for manual testing. It analyzes detected vulnerabilities in detail and determines risk levels. It can create detailed security reports using the findings, including recommendations on how to resolve vulnerabilities. It can also integrate with other security tools, CI/CD pipelines, and ticketing systems.

### Other commercial tools

There are dozens of services of different scales and scopes, such as these services we have given as examples (Qualys VMDR, Rapid7 InsightVM, Nessus Professional, OpenVAS, Burp Suite, etc.). As you may have noticed in the examples above, both services use the CVE database and NVD scoring as a foundation, but they provide traceability, visibility, automation, and enriched context by doing much of the work for you.

In this case, you can use one of these products that suits your business and needs, or you can write your own asset scanners using scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell), extract data from open databases (CVE, NVD APIs), and develop custom security tools by matching and correlating this data.

## Feeds and APIs

It is possible to obtain real-time vulnerability information through automatically updated, commercial or free **feeds and APIs**. For example, you can add new information added to CVE or NVD to your own security products, SIEM, or threat intelligence platforms with the help of feeds or APIs.

You can access **CVE's feeds and APIs** from the following link: [https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#cve_list_data_feeds](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs)

**NVD also provides JSON feeds and APIs** for automated consumption of vulnerability  [https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds)

## Domestic intelligence collection

Analysis of data from monitoring and scanning tools within the organization (e.g., IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanning tools, SIEM, EDR, firewalls) will also provide you with important intelligence.

For example, an alarm occurring on an IDS product may lead you to a malicious application on a user's computer. Let's proceed with an example:

As you know, IDS products generally work with signature databases and look for content that matches those signatures in the packets in the traffic provided to them. The **"cleartext password"** alarm you receive from your IDS product may actually be the only malicious activity caught by the IDS signature of malware that has started to spread inside your network. When you investigate the source of the activity that creates this alarm, you can access the PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) on a user's computer, extract the hash of this PUA, and search for its presence on your other systems. You can stop malicious software before it spreads by blocking it at the endpoint, network, and email gateway levels.

## Security researchers and white hat hackers

Independent security researchers sometimes report security vulnerabilities they find to organizations through **responsible disclosure** or **bug bounty programs**. Additionally, security researchers who do this job professionally regularly publish their findings on their social media accounts (Twitter/X, LinkedIn), personal blogs, GitHub repositories, and conference presentations (Black Hat, DEF CON, BSides).

Following reputable researchers and subscribing to security newsletters can provide early warning of emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

## Zero-day intelligence

Using private intelligence sources is a very useful and common method to detect security vulnerabilities that are **not yet known by the manufacturer or the community** and have not been patched (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this way, you can detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers in the software you use within your organization **before the software manufacturer notifies you**, and take precautions (workarounds, compensating controls, network segmentation, enhanced monitoring).

Zero-day intelligence is typically provided by specialized threat intelligence vendors, government agencies, or closed sharing communities (ISACs, CERTs).

## Last word

Vulnerability Intelligence is not just about detecting vulnerabilities. **Evaluating what these detected vulnerabilities mean for the organization, prioritizing these vulnerabilities based on risk and impact, and coordinating the remediation processes** are also critical components of VI. Effective VI requires integration with asset management, risk management, patch management, and incident response processes.
