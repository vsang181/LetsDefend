## What is a vulnerability?

A **vulnerability** is a weakness or deficiency in a computer system, network, application, or other digital resource. This vulnerability allows malicious actors or software to gain unauthorized access to the system, steal data, misuse system resources, disrupt operations, or perform other harmful actions.

Security vulnerabilities can often arise for many different reasons, including:

- **Software bugs**: Coding errors, logic flaws, or unhandled exceptions that can be exploited.
- **Configuration errors**: Misconfigurations such as default passwords, open ports, excessive permissions, or disabled security features.
- **Weak password policies**: Lack of complexity requirements, password reuse, or absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Outdated software**: Failure to apply security patches or updates, leaving systems exposed to known vulnerabilities.
- **User errors**: Phishing susceptibility, poor security hygiene, or accidental exposure of credentials.
- **Design flaws**: Architectural weaknesses or insecure protocols that are inherently vulnerable.

For example, if software is not updated, it may be exposed to a **known security vulnerability** that attackers can exploit using publicly available exploits. Likewise, if a user uses a weak password or reuses passwords across multiple services, it creates a security vulnerability that can be exploited through credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.

### Why vulnerabilities are dangerous

Another reason why vulnerabilities are dangerous is that they can often **exist for a long time undetected**. This gives attackers an extended window of opportunity to infiltrate the system, establish persistence, move laterally, and carry out their malicious actions (data theft, ransomware deployment, sabotage). Therefore, identifying security vulnerabilities and keeping systems safe by closing these vulnerabilities is of **critical importance** in the world of cybersecurity.

### Managing vulnerabilities

Many different tools and methodologies are available to manage vulnerabilities, including:

- **Vulnerability scanning tools**: Automated scanners that identify known vulnerabilities (Tenable.io, Qualys, Rapid7, Nessus, OpenVAS).
- **Patch management**: Processes and tools for deploying security updates and patches in a timely manner.
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of vulnerability exploitation to prioritize remediation.
- **Security policies and standards**: Establishing baselines, hardening guides, and configuration management practices.
- **Penetration testing**: Manual testing to identify vulnerabilities that automated tools may miss.
- **Security awareness training**: Educating users to reduce human-related vulnerabilities.

However, in order to effectively manage vulnerabilities, these tools and methodologies need to be considered **as a whole** and **constantly updated** to adapt to new threats, changes in the IT environment, and lessons learned from incidents.

## What is vulnerability scanning?

**Vulnerability scanning** is a process used to detect vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, or application in an automatic or semi-automatic manner. These scans are usually performed using specialized software tools (scanners). The aim is to identify potential security vulnerabilities and prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited by malicious actors.

Vulnerability scans work by:

1. **Discovering assets**: Identifying systems, devices, and applications in the environment.
2. **Enumerating services and software**: Determining what operating systems, applications, services, and versions are running.
3. **Matching against vulnerability databases**: Comparing identified software and configurations against known vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, vendor advisories).
4. **Testing for vulnerabilities**: Actively probing systems to confirm the presence of vulnerabilities (e.g., sending crafted requests, checking for missing patches, testing configurations).
5. **Reporting findings**: Generating reports that detail discovered vulnerabilities, risk levels, affected assets, and remediation guidance.

### Types of vulnerability scanning

Vulnerability scans are typically performed in three different categories, depending on the context and target:

#### 1. Static Scan (Static Application Security Testing - SAST)

This type of scanning is performed by **analyzing the application's source code, bytecode, or binaries** without executing the application. It is done before the application is run and tries to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflows, insecure cryptographic implementations, hard-coded credentials).

**Advantages:**

- Can be performed early in the development lifecycle (shift-left security)
- Identifies code-level vulnerabilities and poor coding practices
- Does not require a running application

**Disadvantages:**

- May produce false positives
- Cannot detect runtime or environment-specific vulnerabilities
- Requires access to source code or binaries

#### 2. Dynamic Scanning (Dynamic Application Security Testing - DAST)

This type of scanning is performed in an environment where **the application is running**. The goal is to see how the running application reacts to various inputs and interactions, and to identify possible vulnerabilities (e.g., authentication bypass, XSS, CSRF, insecure API endpoints).

**Advantages:**

- Tests the application as an attacker would see it
- Identifies runtime and configuration vulnerabilities
- Does not require access to source code

**Disadvantages:**

- Can only be performed after the application is deployed or in a test environment
- May miss vulnerabilities in code paths that are not exercised during the scan
- Can be slower and more resource-intensive

#### 3. Interactive (Hybrid) Scanning (IAST - Interactive Application Security Testing)

This type of scanning is a **combination of static and dynamic scanning**. Both code analysis is performed (often using instrumentation or agents embedded in the application) and the application is tested by running it. This approach provides deeper insight by correlating code-level information with runtime behavior.

**Advantages:**

- More accurate and comprehensive vulnerability detection
- Reduces false positives by correlating static and dynamic findings
- Provides detailed remediation guidance with code context

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires integration into the application runtime environment
- May introduce performance overhead during testing
- More complex to set up and manage

### Vulnerability scan policies and templates

Vulnerability scans are usually performed in accordance with a **specific policy or template**. These policies determine:

- What types of vulnerabilities to look for (OS vulnerabilities, application vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, compliance checks)
- How deep to scan (full scan vs. quick scan, authenticated vs. unauthenticated)
- Which assets or network segments to scan
- When to scan (scheduled scans, continuous monitoring, on-demand scans)
- How to report scan results (severity filtering, executive summaries, technical details)

### Scan results and reporting

Scan results are usually presented in a **report**. This report explains in detail:

- The **detected security vulnerabilities** (CVE IDs, descriptions, affected software versions)
- What kind of **risks** these vulnerabilities pose (CVSS scores, exploitability, potential impact)
- How these vulnerabilities can be **remediated** (patch information, configuration changes, workarounds)
- **Compliance status** against industry standards (PCI DSS, HIPAA, CIS benchmarks, etc.)
- **Trends and metrics** (vulnerability counts over time, mean time to remediate, asset coverage)

Reports can be customized for different audiences (technical teams, management, auditors) and exported in various formats (PDF, CSV, JSON, HTML).

## Conclusion

As a result, vulnerability scanning is a **critical part of a cybersecurity strategy**. These scans enable organizations to constantly monitor their security posture, identify weaknesses before attackers do, and act proactively against potential threats. By integrating vulnerability scanning with asset management, patch management, and incident response, organizations can build a robust and resilient vulnerability management program.
