# Phishing Email Analysis

Phishing Email Analysis is the systematic examination of emails suspected to be fraudulent or malicious, with the goal of identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats. The process involves scrutinizing email content, sender identity, headers, and technical artifacts for signs of deception or malicious intent.

Analysts typically look for common phishing techniques including:

- Spoofed or impersonated sender addresses (display name mismatches, lookalike domains)
- Social engineering tactics (urgency, threats, appeals to authority or fear)
- Suspicious or obfuscated links (URL redirects, shortened URLs, homograph attacks)
- Malicious attachments (executable files, Office macros, archive bombs)
- Requests for sensitive information (credentials, payment details, personal data)

More advanced analysis may include examining email headers and SMTP metadata (routing, authentication records, SPF/DKIM/DMARC results), decoding encoded content, sandboxing attachments for dynamic analysis, and applying machine learning models to detect subtle patterns or zero-day phishing campaigns.

The broader goal is twofold: protect sensitive data and systems by understanding adversary tactics, and strengthen the organization's overall email security posture through technical controls (filtering, authentication), user awareness training, and incident response procedures.
