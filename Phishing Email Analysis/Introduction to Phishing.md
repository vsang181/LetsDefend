# Introduction to Phishing

A phishing attack is a social engineering attack designed to trick users into divulging sensitive information or executing malicious code. Typically, the attacker crafts a deceptive email that impersonates a trusted entity (a bank, service provider, or internal team) and includes a malicious link or attachment. When the victim interacts with the payload, the attacker gains access to credentials, payment information, or a foothold on the victim's device or network.

## Phishing in the Cyber Kill Chain

Phishing attacks occupy the **Delivery** phase of the Cyber Kill Chain model—the stage where an attacker transfers pre-crafted malicious content to target systems or people. This places phishing early in the attack lifecycle, making it a critical control point for defense.

## Common phishing tactics

Attackers exploit psychological triggers to lower a user's guard and encourage the click:

- "You have won a gift" (greed)
- "Don't miss out on the big discount" (fear of missing out)
- "If you don't click the link, your account will be suspended" (urgency and fear)
- CEO fraud or executive impersonation (authority)
- Payment or invoice-related requests (business routine)

The language is often designed to bypass rational scrutiny and trigger an emotional response that leads to hasty action.

## Why phishing is effective

Phishing is the most common initial attack vector in real-world breaches. While the stated goal may appear to be stealing passwords, the true target is the **human factor**—the weakest link in any security chain. Once an attacker gains initial user credentials, mailbox access, or device compromise through phishing, they can:

- Escalate privileges and move laterally through the network
- Deploy malware, ransomware, or backdoors
- Steal intellectual property or sensitive data
- Establish long-term persistence
- Launch further attacks against the organization or its customers

Phishing is often the first step in a multi-stage intrusion, which is why organizations prioritize email security controls, user training, and incident response capabilities to detect and contain phishing attacks early.
