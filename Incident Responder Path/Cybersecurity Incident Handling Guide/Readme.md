# Cybersecurity Incident Handling Guide

In this documentation, we will cover how to handle cybersecurity incidents properly, examine incident response processes in their correct order, and incorporate recommendations from NIST's "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide" (NIST Special Publication 800-61). This guide provides a structured framework for detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents, while also emphasizing lessons learned and continuous improvement.

Effective incident handling minimizes the impact of security events, reduces recovery time and costs, preserves evidence for potential legal or forensic purposes, and strengthens an organization's overall security posture through post-incident analysis and refinement of defensive measures.
