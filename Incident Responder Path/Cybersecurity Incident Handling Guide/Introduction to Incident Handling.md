# Introduction to Incident Handling

Although organizations invest in cybersecurity controls, allocate budgets, and deploy security systems, it is still possible to be targeted and experience a cybersecurity incident. No defense is perfect, and determined attackers, zero-day vulnerabilities, insider threats, or simple human error can all lead to security breaches.

To minimize loss and damage, remediate exploited vulnerabilities, and restore services smoothly after an incident, **Incident Response Teams** should be formed **prior to** cybersecurity incidents occurring. Proactive preparation ensures that when an incident happens, the team can respond quickly, systematically, and effectively, rather than reacting in an ad-hoc or chaotic manner.

## Why proper planning is critical

Incident response is a complex process that requires accurate planning and adequate resources. Any inaccurate, incomplete, or overlooked steps can undermine the entire incident response effort, leading to:

- Extended downtime and business disruption
- Greater financial and reputational damage
- Loss or contamination of forensic evidence
- Incomplete eradication of threats, allowing attackers to regain access
- Failure to meet legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations

Proper planning includes defining roles and responsibilities, establishing communication channels, creating runbooks and playbooks, maintaining tools and forensic capabilities, and conducting regular training and exercises.

## NIST and the Cybersecurity Framework

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** is an agency of the United States Department of Commerce whose mission is to promote American innovation and industrial competitiveness. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework helps businesses of all sizes better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data.

NIST publishes authoritative guidance on incident handling through the **"Computer Security Incident Handling Guide"** (NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2), which provides a structured, repeatable methodology for preparing for, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security incidents.

## Reference material

You can access the authoritative resource "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide" (NIST SP 800-61 Revision 2) published by NIST at:

**https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf**

This guide is widely recognized as a foundational reference for incident response practitioners and is used by organizations worldwide to build and mature their incident response capabilities.
