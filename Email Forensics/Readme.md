# Email Forensics

Our "Email Forensics" course delves into the intricate world of email evidence, equipping you with essential skills for investigating and analyzing email communications in legal cases, cybersecurity incidents, and corporate investigations.

## What you'll learn

You will develop proficiency in techniques to identify and extract critical data, trace the origins of emails, and uncover hidden information that may not be immediately visible.

The course covers a range of foundational and advanced topics, including:

- **Email header analysis**: Parsing metadata in email headers to identify sender origins, routing paths, timestamps, Message-IDs, and authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Header analysis is the primary analytical technique for detecting email spoofing, phishing, spam, scams, and internal data leakage.
- **Content and attachment analysis**: Examining email body text, images, and attachments using keyword searches, file carving, MIME decoding (including base64-encoded data), and hash analysis to identify malicious code, hidden messages, or sensitive information.
- **Metadata extraction and correlation**: Analyzing sender IP addresses, email client versions, device identifiers, and timestamps to authenticate emails, link communication patterns, and establish timelines.
- **Deleted email recovery**: Using specialized forensic tools to recover deleted messages from local storage (PST, OST, MBOX, EML files), web-based caches, and volatile memory.
- **Server and network investigation**: Extracting email evidence from mail server logs, firewall logs, DNS queries, and network traffic logs to reconstruct the series of events leading up to email transmission and identify data exfiltration or system compromise.
- **Email client and mailer fingerprinting**: Identifying the software and version used to send emails by examining headers such as `X-Mailer` and `Received` fields, which can aid in profiling the sender's infrastructure.
- **Chain of custody and legal considerations**: Maintaining the integrity of email evidence for legal proceedings, including proper documentation, search warrants for email provider data, and adherence to forensic standards.

## Tools and techniques

The course introduces specialized forensic tools that streamline email investigation, such as EnCase, FTK (Forensic Toolkit), MailXaminer, Belkasoft X, and Autopsy. These tools enable investigators to parse email files, extract metadata, perform keyword searches, decode attachments, and generate comprehensive reports efficiently.

By the end of the course, you'll be proficient in handling email evidence from identification through analysis and reporting, with the ability to trace email origins, identify forgery and spoofing attempts, recover deleted communications, and present findings in a forensically sound manner suitable for legal or security operations contexts.
