# Introduction to Email Forensics

Email is an indispensable part of our daily communication, but it can also be leveraged to commit crimes and illegal activities such as fraud, data theft, impersonation, and espionage. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals, legal investigators, and IT practitioners must be proficient in email forensics. Starting with how email systems work, this Email Forensics course is designed to teach you how to detect, analyze, and respond to potential threats using systematic investigative techniques.

## Content of the course

### Understanding email protocols

The focus of this lesson is the operation of core email protocols such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), and POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3), which form the foundation of email communication. You'll learn the basic principles of each protocol, their role in the exchange and retrieval of email, and their inherent security vulnerabilities (including cleartext transmission risks, lack of native authentication, relay abuse, and susceptibility to interception and spoofing).

### Email forensics tools

This lesson examines the tools, software, and techniques used to analyze email evidence. It focuses on how forensic investigators use specialized applications (such as email header parsers, forensic suites like EnCase and FTK, metadata extractors, and sandbox environments) and how to apply these tools methodically during investigations to extract, preserve, and present evidence in a forensically sound manner.

### Email header analysis

This lesson will discuss how to analyze email headers to obtain critical information such as sender details, recipient addresses, timestamps, IP addresses, routing paths, and authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). You'll learn how to interpret `Received` chains to trace message origins, identify spoofing attempts, and correlate header data with other forensic artifacts in criminal investigations and incident response scenarios.

### Email body analysis

This lesson covers how to examine email body content, including plaintext, HTML rendering, embedded elements (images, scripts), and inline links. Topics include identifying deceptive language patterns, validating link destinations (hover-over vs. actual URL), detecting social engineering tactics (urgency, authority, fear), recognizing content spoofing attempts (brand impersonation, logo cloning), and identifying malicious scripts or hidden iframes that facilitate drive-by downloads or credential harvesting.

### Email attachment analysis

Analyzing email attachments and detecting malware, trojans, ransomware, and other dangerous content is the objective of this lesson. It focuses on how to safely analyze attachments using sandboxing and virtualization, which tools to use for static and dynamic analysis (file hash lookups, signature scanning, behavior monitoring), and how to quarantine potentially harmful attachments. Contextual analysis of attachments (filename patterns, MIME types, compression tricks) and behavioral analysis techniques (process monitoring, network callbacks, file system changes) will also be covered.

### Identifying and analyzing email threats

In this lesson, you will learn how to identify and analyze phishing, spam, business email compromise (BEC), malware distribution campaigns, and other malicious email threats. It identifies common attack tactics (credential harvesting, invoice fraud, CEO impersonation), threat vectors (malicious links, weaponized documents, social engineering), and defense mechanisms (email gateways, DMARC policies, user training, incident response workflows) to mitigate these attacks.

## Objective

The objective of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of email communications and the ability to effectively use the methods and tools of forensic investigation. Email analysis plays a critical role in the collection, preservation, and evaluation of digital evidence for cybersecurity incident response, legal proceedings, and compliance investigations. Knowledge and skills in this area are essential for anyone who wants to specialize in cybersecurity, digital forensics, or threat intelligence.
